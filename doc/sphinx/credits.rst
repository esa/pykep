======================

PyKEP has been created by the PaGMO development Team at the European Space Agency and was once part of the project PaGMO/PyGMO. As of the release 1.0 of PaGMO the decision
was taken to move the entire keplerian_toolbox and its python exposition (PyKEP) to a different project and to keep supporting
complete compatibility between the two projects.

PyKEP is in use at the European Space Agency's Advanced Concepts Team.

**Main Developers**:

Dario Izzo (madsax)

Francesco Biscani (bluescarni)
