    This class represents a rendezvous mission to Saturn modelled as an MGA-1DSM transfer. Mission parameters are
    inspired to the TandEM mission. A launcher model (i.e. Atlas 501) is also used, so that the final mass delivered
    at Saturn is the main objective of this optimization problem.

    The problem draws inspiration from the work performed in April 2008 by the
    European Space Agency working group on mission analysis on the mission named TandEM. TandEM is an interplanetary
    mission aimed at reaching Titan and Enceladus (two moons of Saturn).

    .. note::

       The Titan and Enceladus Mission (TandEM), an ambitious scientific mission to study the Saturnian system
       with particular emphasis on the moons Titan and Enceladus, was selected in October 2007 as a candidate mission
       within the ESA Cosmic Vision plan. In February 2009, TandEM exited the Cosmic Vision programme when ESA
       and NASA chose EJSM-Laplace as the L-class outer Solar System mission candidate.

    .. note::

       A significantly similar version of this problem was part of the no longer maintained GTOP database,
       https://www.esa.int/gsp/ACT/projects/gtop/gtop.html. The exact definition is, though, different and results
       cannot thus not be compared to those posted in GTOP.
